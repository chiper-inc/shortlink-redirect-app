/**
 *`Toasts` are used to provide users with brief, snackable notifications or messages
 * that appear and disappear quickly, often at the bottom or top of the screen.
 * They're used to communicate important but not critical information, such as
 * successful actions, errors, or warnings, without interrupting the user's
 * flow or requiring them to take immediate action.
 *
 * #### Usage:
 *
 * ```tsx
  import { Toast, Theme } from "@chiper-inc/sb-web-chiper";

  <Toast
    title="El titulo"
    body="Lorem psum......"
    className="sbw-fixed sbw-top-8"
  />
 * ```
 *
 ***Note**: You can set the Toast position using `className` property
 *
 * #### Demo:
 */
export declare const Toast: import("react").MemoExoticComponent<({ type, title, body, actionText, onActionTextClick, hideCloseIcon, onCloseClick, className, children, }: IToast) => import("react/jsx-runtime").JSX.Element>;
